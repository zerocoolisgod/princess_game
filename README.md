Update 2017-05-27
  - complete GUI overhaul
  - enemy spawners
  - level work
  - sub weapon system
  - dragonflies (candles from Castlevania)
  - enemies have a chance of dropping health or sub weapon energy
  
Working on
  - 2 or 4 new enemy types
  - 3 more sub weapons
  - 4 boss fights
  - 4 total "Acts" each containing 4 or 5 short "stages" and a boss fight.
    (I have 1 act and its 5 stages "done.")
  - character select; just palette swaps and a “prince”, the kid likes picking from the different colored princesses, I might connect the palette swaps to the different sub weapons like mega man.
 
  - general balancing
      item drops rates
      enemy damage and placement 
      etc.
